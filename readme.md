# IRA format

### What is it for?
IRA is a binary format for storing images as bytecode of compact virtual machine.
When you open a file in this format the virtual machine executes the code
inside the file and visualizes the result of the execution.
This format is theoretically more optimal than any other in terms of file size,
provided there is a smart enough converter into this format.
However, such a converter has not been implemented yet.
Also, the format itself is at a very early stage of development.


### Progress
- [ ] Try not to waste time on this project and do something useful instead.
- [x] Come up with a project name and file extension.
- [ ] Design virtual machine instruction set.
- [ ] Design file format structure.
- [ ] Implement encoder.
- [ ] Implement decoder.
